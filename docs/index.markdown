title: The Powerful Influence of Literature on Cinema ?
---

# Where did everything started?
After dropping my studies in data science, I wanted to pursue a life in my passion of all time: **Literature**.\
Regrettably, the industry of literature is falling due to new technologies and social networks, and at this time, it’s becoming impossible to make a life out of writing books. Having this bitter taste in my mouth, I decided to use my background in data science to fight for my dreams and make my books as profitable as possible.\
My idea was to analyze **the influence of Literature on Cinema**. I wanted to understand what factors would make my books more likely to be adapted to the big screen. Finally, I want to make royalties, but money is not what matters most to me. What is most important is to spread my stories all around the world, and I need to analyze what divergences could appear, in order to protect my stories at all cost.

# Data Alchemy : Transforming Literature into Cinema

## White Work : Albedo.

Under the symbol of purification, we begin the first part of the work, also known as the Opus albedo (The Work of White). Long and toilsome, this stage is of great import, for it is through this refining that we may gain the pure substance upon which our future inquiries shall rest. As the alchemists of old sought to cleanse their base matter to bring forth gold, so must we cleanse our data, that it may serve as the foundation for that which is to come.

## Black Work : Nigredo.

Now that we have purged the impurities, we must summon the courage to face the shadowed depths of our data, and delve into the dark recesses that lie within. What secrets does this matter hold, waiting to be revealed unto us?
Breaking asunder the old and the familiar, we are left with the raw and undefined form, marking the second step in this great unfolding—the Opus Nigredo, the Work of Blackening. It is the commencement of the process of separation, wherein we strive to draw forth the essence of our data.


## Yellow Work : Awakening.

Amidst the doubts and perils that beset our journey, fate weaves our path with that of an old grimoire. This venerable tome, passed from one alchemist to another across the ages and lands , bears the chronicles of those who, in their own wise, sought to unveil the great enigma. Thus do we come to the third stage of the alchemical journey, known as the Opus Citrinum, the Work of Yellowing, where we open our eyes towards the world and the wisdom of our peers.

## Red Work : Rubedo.

In this final stage, we come unto the completion of our toil, the Opus Rubedo, the Work of Reddening. Here, we gather all the fragments of our quest, binding together the purified data and the wisdom we have wrought. Through the art of sentiment analysis, we trace the shifting paths of emotion in both the book and its film, uncovering the bond between their ratings, and revealing how one doth shape the other, as base matter is transmuted into gold.
