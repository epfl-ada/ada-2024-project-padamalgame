title: The Powerful Influence of Literature on Cinema ?
---

# Where did everything started?
After dropping my studies in data science, I wanted to pursue a life in my passion of all time: **Literature**.\
Regrettably, the industry of literature is falling due to new technologies and social networks, and at this time, itâ€™s becoming impossible to make a life out of writing books. Having this bitter taste in my mouth, I decided to use my background in data science to fight for my dreams and make my books as profitable as possible.\
My idea was to analyze **the influence of Literature on Cinema**. I wanted to understand what factors would make my books more likely to be adapted to the big screen. Finally, I want to make royalties, but money is not what matters most to me. What is most important is to spread my stories all around the world, and I need to analyze what divergences could appear, in order to protect my stories at all cost.
