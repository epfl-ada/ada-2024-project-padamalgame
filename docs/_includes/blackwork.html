    <h2 class="book-title">Black Work : Nigredo.</h2>
    <h3 class="book-subtitle">* <i>The Black Work, or Nigredo, is the initial stage of the alchemical process, characterized by decomposition and dissolution. It represents the breaking down of old structures and the confronting of the shadow aspects of the self. This phase involves a deep introspection and the confrontation of one's darker aspects, often symbolized by death and decay. The goal is to clear the way for transformation by letting go of what no longer serves.</i></h3>
