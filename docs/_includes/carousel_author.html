      <h3 class="carousel-subtitle">A One-Hit Wonder</h3>
      <p class="carousel-paragraph">The strategy of our first literary alchemist is both the simplest and perhaps the most
        difficult to replicate. In 1865, Lewis Carroll wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
        a work that has since become a timeless classic. Over the years, it has been adapted into
        nearly 13 different films, spanning from 1915 to 2010. This remarkable success highlights
        the enduring power of Carroll's creation, demonstrating how a single work can continue to
        resonate with audiences and be reinterpreted across different generations. His secret ingredient ?
        The art of a blending whimsical yet refreshing absurdity with deeper philosophical ideas.

      <h1 class="carousel-title">Agatha Christie</h1>
      <h3 class="carousel-subtitle">The Serial Writer</h3>
      <p class="carousel-paragraph">Our second alchemist's strategy is clever and captivating: Agatha Christie created the character Hercule Poirot and placed him at the center of a series of increasingly intricate adventures. Her secret lies in her mastery of intrigue, paired with the creation of an endearing character. This combination fosters a strong emotional connection with the audience, making it ideal for a series of adaptations, spin-offs, and episodic stories that keep viewers engaged. Murder and intrigue are the hallmarks of her work, be careful if you follow her leads, as they may send a chill down your spine!

      <h1 class="carousel-title">Jules Verne</h1>
      <h3 class="carousel-subtitle">The 20 Thousands Ideas</h3>
      <p class="carousel-paragraph">Our last but not least alchemist pushes the boundaries of imagination. Jules Verne's strategy was to create a vast array of novels, each with unique characters and worlds. Despite the distinctiveness of each universe, whether set under the sea or in space, every story holds an adventure that consistently attracts interest and adaptation. Verneâ€™s genius lies in crafting tales so compelling that they all translate into successful box-office films, regardless of the generations. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or Around the World in 80 Days are among those familiar stories, deeply rooted in the narratives that have shaped our childhood and beyond.
